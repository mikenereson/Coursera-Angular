##Notes
* Each page allows me to download the lecture video and transcript.
* [Coursera for Business](https://www.coursera.org/enterprise)
  * 1 course = $110 per user per year
  * All courses = $400 per user per year
  * access to all courses
  * some reporting for admins as to who is taking what course, how far along, and whats completed

##Issues
* As reference material, I can't skip ahead to week 7 to find information until I complete weeks 1 though 6
* when I submit files, are they searchable?
* Forum - async, I can't go live with teachers/classmates NOW to get through an issue
* Watching a video where I "setup my development environment" 
  * Instructor installs about 5 development apps over 25 minutes 
  * I already have a dev environment, so I don't need any of this
  * BUT he mentions one app in the intro that I don't know about and am interested 
    in learning about, I then had to skip through the 25 minutes of video trying to 
    find the section on this one tool. Bookmarks could have handled this better. 
  

##Complaints
* One of my complaints with the video format is that I get an intro and potentially review of what I just watched every 3-5 minutes...
